# Realm of Algorithms
 
This repository is a personal space for experimenting with algorithms, exploring different problem-solving strategies, and analyzing performance characteristics.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to provide a flexible environment for playing with algorithms. It serves as a sandbox for testing various approaches to common computational problems, whether for learning, performance benchmarking, or curiosity-driven exploration.

## What You'll Find Here

- Multiple implementations of common algorithms (e.g., sorting, searching, graph traversal, dynamic programming)
- Performance benchmarks to compare execution time and memory usage
- Comparative studies of algorithmic strategies such as brute-force, greedy, divide-and-conquer, and dynamic programming
- Edge case testing to understand limitations and behavior under different conditions
- Visualizations and insights to better understand algorithmic behavior
- Notes and observations from experiments for future reference
